		<h1 class="content">WHO AM I?</h1>
		<p>I'm <b>LiChunliang</b>, currently a student of BIT, and you may call me by one of my nicknames, "<b>Edge</b>".(How about "<b>jbji</b>"?) I'm fond of doing with Mathematics, especially fields related with <b>algebra</b> and <b>topology</b>. And, CS? That's just my current major. Beyond that, my interest covers a variety of fields, say, Computer Graphics.<br>
		</p>
		<p>To technically describe my character? Well, I am categorized between ENTP and INTP (with the former type a little bit more frequent), according to the MBTI test. To find out more about that, why not use a search engine? </p>
		<p>By the way, I need to make it clear that, this page, or all this blog, is a work for my Web lesson.</p>
